# Textep - Text editor primitive
Basic app to edit txt files for MRE platform (including Nokia S30+). If exists automatically open "Textep.txt" file on storage card or phone memory. If change app name default name would be changed. For new file their name is autogenerated from current date and time. App make file copies on storage card before change this information. Limited file size for editing 2000 characters, dont use for greater files bacause data affter 2000 characters would be not saved. Key "OK" save editing changes and exit, key "Exit" close application without saving changes. Edited files will be saved with UTF8 encoding. Tested on Nokia 225 with display resolution 240x320. For using with Nokia mobile phone, app must be signed with IMSI (your SIM card) code. https://vxpatch.luxferre.top/
